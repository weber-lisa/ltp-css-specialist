        <h1>Waxhaw, NC</h1>

        <h2>Location & Naming the Town</h2>
        <p>
            The Town of Waxhaw is located only 20 minutes from south Charlotte and approximately three miles from the
            South Carolina state line.</p>
        <p>
            Dating back to the 1700s, Waxhaw is one of the oldest towns in Union County, taking its name from the
            Waxhaws (originally called the Wysacky), an Indian tribe that once inhabited the area. When chartered in
            1889, Waxhaw established its rightful place as the third oldest town in Union County.

        <h2> Historic Places</h2>
        <p>With a population of over 10,500 people, Waxhaw has managed to maintain its small town charm and yet
            continue to achieve quality growth. The Waxhaw Historic District at the heart of town is on the National
            Register of Historic Places and boasts proud old buildings and unique attractions.</p>

        <p>The most iconic attraction is the pedestrian bridge that crosses over the railroad tracks. It was once used
            for automobiles to cross over while trains ran through town below it. In 1940 it was designated for
            pedestrians only and is still used daily by adults and children standing on the bridge waiting for a train
            to pass underneath their feet.</p>

        <h2>Water Tower</h2>
        <p>
            The large water tower standing tall over downtown Waxhaw has served as a beacon for many citizens who recall
            playing under it as children or beckoning a tired traveler home from a long time on the road.
